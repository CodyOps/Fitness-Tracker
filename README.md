## Description:

The goal of this assignment was to create a workout tracker. This application was created using Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

## User Story:

As a user, I would like to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given date. I also want to be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and durations of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the application will be able to track the distance that was travelled.
